For the API, I have chosen the Stranger Things Quotes API: https://strangerthingsquotes.shadowdev.xyz/.
The API generates a random quote that shows the quote and author of the quote.
Two java classes, in addition to the main class, were created: APIController and StrangerThingsQuotes.
APIController contains the '/quote', similar to the '/brew' demo, uses a loop to get the generated quote.
The StrangerThingsQuote class contains the necessary setters and getters for the author and quote.
